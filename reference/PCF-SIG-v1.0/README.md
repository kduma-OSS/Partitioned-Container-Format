# pcf-sig — PCF Cryptographic Signatures (reference implementation)

Reference reader/writer for **PCF-SIG v1.0**, an application-level profile
that adds digital signatures to the [Partitioned Container Format](../PCF-v1.0)
without modifying the PCF byte container.

This crate mirrors the written specification (`specs/PCF-SIG-spec-v1.0.txt`)
field-for-field and is intended as the *normative* implementation against
which language ports are checked. It favours auditability over performance.

## Model at a glance

PCF-SIG defines two new PCF partition types:

| Type         | Name         | Holds                                                    |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0xAAAB0001` | `PCFSIG_KEY` | One signer's public key or X.509 cert, identified by a 32-byte SHA-256 fingerprint of the key bytes |
| `0xAAAB0002` | `PCFSIG_SIG` | One Manifest enumerating signed partitions + the signature over the Manifest |

A **Manifest** binds the *protected fields* of each covered partition:
`uid`, `partition_type`, `label`, `used_bytes`, `data_hash_algo_id`,
`data_hash`. It does NOT bind `start_offset` or `max_length`, so PCF
compaction and other relocations preserve signature validity as long as
partition bytes do not change.

```
PCFSIG_SIG partition data:
[ Manifest (60 + 218 * N bytes) | u32 sig_len | sig_bytes | u32 trailer_len=0 ]
```

## Algorithm support

| `sig_algo_id` | Algorithm           | This crate v1.0 |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1             | Ed25519 (RFC 8032)  | implemented (MUST) |
| 2, 4, 5, 7    | RSA-PSS / PKCS1v15  | registry only    |
| 16, 18        | ECDSA P-256 / P-521 | registry only    |
| 32            | X.509 chain         | registry only    |

Algorithms in *registry only* are recognised at parse time and reported as
`Unverifiable` rather than `Malformed`. Adding a full implementation for any
of them is a pure addition that does not touch the on-disk format.

Hash algorithm constraint: signed partitions MUST use a cryptographic
`data_hash_algo_id` (16 SHA-256, 17 SHA-512, 18 BLAKE3). The Writer refuses
to sign weakly-hashed partitions; the Verifier rejects them per entry.

## Usage

```rust
use std::io::Cursor;
use pcf::{Container, HashAlgo};
use pcf_sig::{sign_partitions, verify_all_with_recheck, ManifestVerdict, SigningMaterial};

let mut c = Container::create(Cursor::new(Vec::new()))?;
let alpha = [0x11u8; 16];
c.add_partition(0x10, alpha, "alpha", b"Hello, PCF-SIG!", 0, HashAlgo::Sha256)?;

let signer = SigningMaterial::ed25519_from_seed(&[0x42u8; 32]);
sign_partitions(
    &mut c, &signer,
    &[alpha],
    [0x33u8; 16],  // PCFSIG_SIG uid
    [0x22u8; 16],  // PCFSIG_KEY uid (reused if a key with the same fingerprint already exists)
    0,             // signed_at_unix_seconds (0 = unspecified)
    "pcfsig", "pcfkey",
)?;

for report in verify_all_with_recheck(&mut c)? {
    assert!(matches!(report.verdict, ManifestVerdict::Valid));
    for entry in &report.entries {
        println!("covered uid {:?} verdict {:?}", entry.uid, entry.verdict);
    }
}
# Ok::<(), pcf_sig::Error>(())
```

## Command-line tool

A ready-made CLI lives in [`tools/pcf-sig`](../../tools/pcf-sig) (`pcf-sig`),
built on this crate:

```sh
pcf-sig keygen id.key id.pub          # 32-byte raw Ed25519 seed + public key
pcf-sig sign   file.pcf --key id.key  # incremental by default; --resign to redo
pcf-sig verify file.pcf --key id.pub  # per-signature / per-partition report
pcf-sig keys   file.pcf               # list embedded PCFSIG_KEY fingerprints
```

A PFS-MS archive is a PCF file, so `pcf-sig verify`/`keys` work on it directly;
to *sign* a PFS-MS file use `pfs sign`, which commits the signature as a PFS
session (see [`reference/PFS-MS-v1.0`](../PFS-MS-v1.0)).

## Trust patterns

The profile describes one non-X.509 way for an application to express trust
in spec Section 12.

**Pattern A — self-binding key attestations.** Carry a JWT, SCITT statement,
or custom signed envelope as an application-private TLV entry (tag range
`0x8000..0xFFFF`) inside the `PCFSIG_KEY` partition (Section 6.4). The
attestation MUST internally commit to the key's SHA-256 fingerprint (e.g.
JWT `cnf.jkt`); otherwise the binding is meaningless because the fingerprint
covers only `key_data`, not the TLV. The application verifies the
attestation independently of PCF-SIG.

## Relocation stability

The central property: a PCFSIG_SIG signature remains valid across any
operation that touches only the unprotected fields. `tests/relocation.rs`
exercises this end-to-end:

- PCF compaction (full rewrite, every `start_offset` and `max_length`
  changes) — signature still verifies.
- Table Block chain growth (extra blocks inserted, chain re-linked) —
  signature still verifies.
- In-place update of a sibling UNSIGNED partition — signature still verifies.

Run from this directory:

```
cargo test
cargo run --example gen_testvector       # writes pcfsig_testvector.bin
```

The canonical test vector is 966 bytes; its SHA-256 is printed on stderr
when the example runs. Ports are expected to reproduce the same bytes.
